Simple example of Fractal generation using recursive function.

What is Sierpinski Triangle?
>>The Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpinski), also called
the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve, is a fractal and attractive fixed set
with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller
equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic
examples of self-similar sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that can
be reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish
mathematician Wac≈Çaw Sierpinski, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries
prior to the work of Sierpinski.
